## 7.2 - Your Tribute Page

You will now be using git and vscode to:

  * _clone_ your repository to your local machine (use the HTTPS link)

  * _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files with your own code (from CodePen) 

  * _add, commit and push_ your changes to your brand new repository. Pretty cool eh?
